## Project Overview

The RESTful API provides functionalities for user authentication, post and comment management, like and friendship systems, and a secure OTP-based password reset feature. It uses modular ES6 syntax for better maintainability and MongoDB for efficient data handling.

## Features

### User Authentication

- User registration with fields: name, email, password, gender.
- Login and logout functionalities.
- Advanced feature: Logout from all devices by storing login tokens in an array field within the user's document.

### Post Management

- CRUD operations for posts with fields: caption and image URL.
- Posts reference the user who created them.
- Posts can be updated or deleted only by their owner.

### Comment System

- Add, update, and delete comments on posts.
- Comments can only be updated or deleted by their owner or the commenter.

### Like Functionality

- Like/unlike posts.
- Count and display likes and comments on posts.
- Populate user information (id, name, email) for likes, comments, and posts.

### Friendship Features

- Manage user friendships with features like:
  - Get user friends.
  - Manage pending friend requests.
  - Toggle friendships.
  - Accept/reject friend requests.

### User Profile Updates

- Update user profiles (name, gender, avatar).
- Enable avatar uploads for user profiles.

### OTP-Based Password Reset

- Send OTP for password reset using Nodemailer.
- Verify OTP and reset the password.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a `.env` file for environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secret, email configurations).
3. Set up a MongoDB database.
4. Start the server.

## Dependency Installation

Run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm index.js
```

This project showcases a robust RESTful API architecture with modular design, user-friendly features, and secure data handling.

## Technologies Used
